# quantox_test
Hello, 
I finished the test and i am sending it to you.
I worked with Virtual Host, and htaccess is working with virtual host.
I think i covered everything, in the database is just one table with one user.
You will need just virtual host.
WEBROOT constant is in index that the domain.  
I hope everything is working.
I didn't add any content on start page, i hope that is not problem, i didn't have idea what to put.
Thank you on opportunity.
Sincerely,
Drndarevic Milan.
